                It is good to get first-hand information from 
                students about co-curricular activities conducted in the college. 
                Co-curricular activities like music, dance and drama are essential for holistic development of the mind and body. A good co-curricular program is 
                another factor that could decide college admissions.

                One of the most frequently asked questions on college admissions is what kind of college is best suited for your requirements.

                Here, your college consultant already has a well-planned database of colleges. A good college consultant will already know which college is the best for a particular course.
                
                Remember to inform your consultant of your interests, hobbies, career plans and financial situation. This information helps your consultant to narrow down the list of colleges that are best suited for you.
